def merge(dict1, dict2):
    score_dict = {}
    
#score_dict = dict1 | dict2  this works for python 3.9 and later.  The code below is for other versions and more explicit.

    for key in dict1:
        score_dict[key] = dict1[key]
    #iterates the key and assigns
    for key in dict2:
        score_dict[key] = dict2[key]
    return score_dict
    
def total_score(score_dict):
    scoring = 0 
    vals = score_dict.values()
# this pulls the value pairs from the score_dict
    for value in vals:
        scoring += value
# iterates over the value pairs and adds them to the score requirement.  
    return scoring
    pass
